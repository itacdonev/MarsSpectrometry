    "- **SAM testbed**: the data comes from the SAM testbed at Goddard, a replica of the SAM instrument suite on Curiosity\n",

    "- Commercial instruments measure ion abundance as ion current in amps (Coulombs per second), while the SAM testbed measures abundance as counts per second. This results in their respective samples having drastically different orders of magnitude for their abundance values. As noted in the previous section, however, the key idea is to compare relative abundance values within one sample's run, and not to compare absolute abundance values across samples.\n",
    "- Commercial instrument runs will have ion abundance measurements for all m/z values at every timestep of measurement. The SAM testbed can only measure abundance for one m/z value at a time—the mass spectrometer scans across m/z values in ascending order and cycles through its range of detection.\n",
    "- Commercial instrument runs were generally configured to collect data for whole number m/z values from 0.0 to 100.0. The SAM testbed detects ions for a larger range of m/z values, up to 534.0 or 537.0, and data sometimes includes fractional m/z values.\n",
    "    - In general, ions relevant to the detection of the label classes for this competition will be within the 0.0–100.0 range.\n",
    "    - In general, if fractional m/z abundances are significant, they will be highly correlated to those of the nearest whole number m/z, e.g., m/z=1.9 will be highly correlated with 2.0. For EGA data, it is generally enough to only look at the whole number m/z values and ignore the fractional m/z values.\n",
